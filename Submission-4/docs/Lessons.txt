4. We reviewed work of other groups to see where we stand and where we need improvement.

B. Negatives of the Group(2)

1. Some members of the group are not well initiated.
2. Complexity of the project due to so much detail made us compromise on GUI/front end.

C. What would we do differently next time ?

1. Would manage the priorities between the code complexity and other features such as GUI to achieve optimal output. 
2. Will try to keep each and every member motivated.
