Readme for submission 3

The project aims to simulate Zephyr, showing the operations & sequence of events that go on. 
Our project does not use any database or UI as of now. The standard output (console) is being used to simulate the event.
With each run of the program, the outputs of the simulation would be different, as the variables are being simulated randomly.
In the incomplete classes, the method stubs have been generated, but some of the implementaion is left.
All the variables in the Constants.java class, can be modified to observe significant changes in the simulation, and depending on the feedback received from the instructor and assistants, we would make them user defined or let it remain as constants.
